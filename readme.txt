## Static Files Management

- **static/**  
  Contains source static files used during development by Django apps.

- **staticfiles/**  
  Contains collected static files generated by `collectstatic`.  
  This directory is served directly by **NGINX** in production for better performance.

---

## Deployment

The project is deployed using **Docker Desktop** with the following services:

- Django web service (`chapter17-web`)
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- NGINX reverse proxy

NGINX is responsible for:
- Serving static files from `staticfiles/`
- Acting as a reverse proxy for Django
- Handling SSL certificates to enable HTTPS

---

## Domain & Security

- Domain (run with docker) : https://medicareproject/
- Domain : 
- HTTPS enabled using SSL certificates
- Sensitive configuration stored in `.env` file

⚠️ The `.env` file is excluded from version control.

---

## Run with Docker

Build and start the containers:

```bash
docker compose up --build
